This package uses the [whisper](https://github.com/openai/whisper). Please visit the site and follow the installation instructions for your system. 

*Tip:* On windows I run in the following [problem](https://discuss.pytorch.org/t/failed-to-import-pytorch-fbgemm-dll-or-one-of-its-dependencies-is-missing/201969). 
For me installing [libomp](https://www.dllme.com/dll/files/libomp140_x86_64/00637fe34a6043031c9ae4c6cf0a891d/download) solved the problem.

You also need to install numpy.
